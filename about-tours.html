                        Kyoto is figuratively called the "city of a thousand temples", although in fact there are more
                        than one and a half thousand Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines and shrines. The entire
                        territory of historical Kyoto is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is a unique world practice.
                        The city is divided into several districts - Central, East, South, West and North Kyoto. Each of
                        them houses a number of architectural structures, streets and quarters, which are important
                        historical sights. In Central Kyoto, the Gosho Imperial Palace, the former residence of the
                        Imperial Family of Japan, is located, which can only be entered by advance booking. Not far from
                        it is Nijo Castle, built as the residence of the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate, Ieyasu
                        Tokugawa in 1603, at the very beginning of the Edo era. This majestic castle, built in the
                        “Momoyama” style, was designed to rival the scope and beauty of Gosho Palace. The Buddhist
                        temples Nishihogenji and Higashihongenji are located in the same area. The Amidado Hall at
                        Nishihogenji Temple is dedicated to Amida Buddha. The Higashiyama Historic District in East
                        Kyoto recreates the ancient atmosphere of the city with its narrow picturesque streets and
                        ancient temples. In the same area is the famous Kyoto temple Kiyomizudera - “Temple of Pure
                        Water”. It was founded back in 780. The water in this temple, according to local belief, has
                        healing powers. In the eastern part of the city there is another famous temple, Sanjusangendo,
                        which is the longest wooden structure in Japan with a length of 120 meters. In the main hall is
                        a large statue of the goddess Kannon the Merciful, another incarnation of the Buddha.

                        Mount Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan. Its height is 3776 meters. It was formed as a
                        result of volcanic activity about one hundred thousand years ago. Today, Mount Fuji and its
                        surroundings are a popular tourist area where you can go hiking, live in nature and just relax.
                        Fuji is the most famous symbol of the Land of the Rising Sun. People from all over the world
                        come here to see this incredible natural wonder. For the Japanese themselves, Fuji is one of the
                        most revered shrines, a source of national pride and an endless source of inspiration.
                        The spiritual connection of the Japanese with Fuji has been forged for centuries. Legend has it
                        that the famous ascetic Hasegawa Kakugyo (1541–1646) made over a hundred ascents of the
                        mountain. His exploits led to the formation of the Fuji-ko, a Shinto-Buddhist sect of mountain
                        worshipers. They built shrines, erected stone monuments, and observed fasting as a token of
                        their devotion. Such fanaticism led to the banning of the sect from the lands of the Tokugawa
                        shogunate. Despite this, the old tradition of mountain worship is still alive in Japan. They are
                        revered as places of great spiritual importance.

                        Unlike most cities in Japan, Sapporo is a spacious and green city. One of the best islands of
                        nature is Odori Park, which divides the city into northern and southern parts. It stretches for
                        about a mile and a half along 12 blocks. During the warm months it is pleasant to walk here. In
                        February, the Snow Festival is held in the park.
                        Sapporo has a lot of space. The wonders of nature are combined here with fantastic modern
                        sculptures at the Sapporo Art Park, Arte Piazza Bibai and Black Slide Mantra. In the park of

                        Prefecture. Founded in 1916 by granting the village the status of a city. On January 1, 2006,
                        the city swallowed up the Nukata settlement of the Nukata district. Okazaki is the center of the
                        textile industry.

                        A park for the Okazaki citizens built on the castle grounds. Within the park, there are many
                        historic sites such as the Okazaki Castle, the Ninomaru Noh Theater, and the Tatsuki Shrine. At
                        the Mikawa Bushi Museum, associated with Ieyasu Tokugawa, you can try on warrior armor and
                        helmets. In April when the cherry trees bloom, a beautiful scene is created with the castle in
                        the background.

                        Osaka (Jap. 大阪市 O: saka-shi (inf.)) is the third most populated city in Japan, which is
                        located in the southern part of the island of Honshu, near the mouth of the Yodo River in Osaka
                        Bay. The center of the prefecture of the same name. Since 1956, it has the status of a city,
                        determined by government decree.
                        Osaka is called the "Japanese Venice", because the city is pierced by many river branches and
                        man-made canals, through which over 1000 bridges are thrown. It is called "the culinary capital
                        of Japan", because the local cuisine is extremely diverse, and local chefs stand out for their
                        skill. Osaka is the most noisy and cheerful city in Japan, the most vibrant and diverse. It
                        impresses with its original architecture and the good nature of the locals. Osaka is amazing!

                        Saitama, the capital of the prefecture of the same name, is only half an hour from Tokyo. In
                        2001, Urawa, Omiya and several other municipalities joined the city area. First of all, Saitama
                        is a residential city, where most of the population travels every day to Tokyo for work. That is
                        why Saitama Station is an important transportation hub serving several suburban lines, as well
                        as Tohoku Shinkansen and Joetsu Shinkansen.
                        And although the city is undeservedly bypassed by tourists, there is something to see here. The
                        Railway Museum, opened in 2007, boasts an interesting display of old trains, interactive
                        simulators and modern railway technology. The museum's collection includes diesel and steam
                        locomotives, retired shinkansen, passenger and freight cars. All this can be seen from the
                        inside.
                        Among the stimulants is the most popular simulator for driving a steam locomotive, the only one
                        that can be used for an additional fee. All other simulators are free, but they require time
                        reserves, since the queue of those who wish can be long.
                        On the roof of the museum there is a garden with a small cafe where you can have a cup of coffee
                        while watching the trains go by.
                        Lovers of Japanese flora should definitely visit Omiya, a bonsai village. Here, in a calm and
                        peaceful atmosphere, different types of this endemic grow. You can look into the art center or
                        look into the courtyards of private houses, where entire bonsai gardens usually grow.

                        Ueno is one of the main stations on the JR Yamanote Line, four stops from Tokyo Station. It is
                        served by the Ginza and Hibiya subway lines. Shinkansen go through the same station, heading to
                        the west coast and northeast of Japan.
                        Many come here to visit world-class galleries and museums. All of them are in the park. The most
                        famous are the National Museum of Western Art, the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Tokyo
                        National Museum, the National Science Museum, and the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan (Tokyo Hall of
                        Culture). Probably the most unique and interesting museum for foreigners is Shitamachi. It
                        introduces guests to life in Tokyo as it was over 100 years ago.
